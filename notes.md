### Hash function
- implement a finer hash function (the current one is deterministic -> NOT GOOD!!!)
### Primality test
- implement the miller-rabin test
- tune the amount of iterations of the mr test
- try to implement a better primality test than the Miller Rabin one 
### Linked lists
- insertions should be made at the beginning of the list, not at the end, just for performance reasons
### Performance optimization
- Try to use dynamic arrays instead of linked lists -> performance improvement
